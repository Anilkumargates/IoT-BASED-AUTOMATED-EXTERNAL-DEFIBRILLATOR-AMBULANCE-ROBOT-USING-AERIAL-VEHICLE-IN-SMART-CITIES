IoT BASED AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR AMBULANCE ROBOT USING AERIAL VEHICLE IN SMART CITIES Time is a critical issue when dealing with people who experience a sudden cardiac arrest that unfortunately could die due to inaccessibility of emergency treatment. An immediate treatment using automated external defibrillator must be administered to the victim within few minutes. We are proposing an ambulance robot which brings an automated external defibrillator in a sudden event of cardiac arrest &amp; facilities of various modes operation to save someoneâ€™s lives.
